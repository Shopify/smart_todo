[![Build Status](https://github.com/Shopify/smart_todo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Shopify/smart_todo/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

_SmartTodo_  is a library designed to assign users on TODO comments written in your codebase and help assignees be reminded when it's time to commit to their TODO.

Installation
-----------
1) Add the gem in your Gemfile.
```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'smart_todo', require: false # No need to require it
end
```
2) Run `bundle install`


Summary
---------
SmartTodo allows to write TODO comments alongside your code and assign a user to it.
When the TODO's event is met (i.e. a certain date is reached), the TODO's assignee will get pinged on Slack.

**Without SmartTodo**
```ruby
  # TODO: Warning! We need to change the API endpoint on July 1st because the provider
  # is modifying its API.
  def api_call
  end
```

-------------------

**With SmartTodo**
```ruby
  # TODO(on: date('2019-07-01'), to: 'john@example.com')
  #   The API provider is modifying its endpoint, we need to modify our code.
  def api_call
  end
```
